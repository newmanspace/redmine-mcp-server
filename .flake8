# Maximum line length

# Ignore specific error codes:
# E722 - do not use bare 'except' (common pattern, will fix later)
# F401 - 'module' imported but unused (common in service layers)
# F841 - local variable is assigned to but never used (common pattern)
# F821 - undefined name (some helper functions are dynamically defined)
# E265 - block comment should start with '#' (style issue, not critical)
# E402 - module level import not at top of file (common in service initialization)
# F824 - `global` is unused (will fix later)
# F541 - f-string is missing placeholders (will fix gradually)
# W291 - trailing whitespace (style issue)
# E126 - continuation line over-indented (style issue, black handles formatting)
# W503 - line break before binary operator (deprecated, W504 is preferred)
# E501 - line too long (SQL queries, will fix gradually)
# E226 - missing whitespace around arithmetic operator (i+1 is acceptable)
# F811 - redefinition of unused (date is used in type hints)
